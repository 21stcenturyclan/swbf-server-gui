# SWBF Server GUI

## Disclamer

> This is a work in progress.

## HowTo

Choose a release version [here](https://github.com/21stcenturyclan/swbf-server-gui/releases).
If you decided for a version then download the server executable.

After you have done this, you can start the executable.

The program will look for the steam executable in the standard directory.
If you have steam install in a custom location and the program does not find it you have to specify it by hand.
For this click the 'Select Executable' button and choose the executable.

Then you can start customizing your server.
Most selectable options should be self explaining.

The map selection works almost the same as in the in-game server creation UI.
1. Select a map you like to add.
2. Specify the number of tickets. This has to be done for each individual map.
3. Decide what era you want to play. A enabled checkbox means that GCW is selected, otherwise its CW. This also has to be done for each individual map.
4. Click the right arrow symbol '->'.
5. You should see the server options on the right changing. Also the table on the right should have you map in it.

When you did all the steps you can start the server by clicking on the play symbol.

You can stop the server by clicking on the stop symbol.
